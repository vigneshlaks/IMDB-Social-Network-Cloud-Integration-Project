# What you liked
feedback_liked: |
  I liked the fact that we were able to use the same code from HW2MS1 and build upon it. This made the assignment much easier to complete. I also liked the fact that we were able to use the same test cases from HW2MS1 and build upon them. This made it easier to test the code and make sure that it was working properly.
  

# What you disliked and suggestions for improvement

  I think the autograder is buggy and doesn't always work. This assignment was definitely better than previous with respect to quality though the bar is not that high.
